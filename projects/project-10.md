summary: An ocean-sensing platform meant to accompany long-term ocean science experiments in the field and track environmental conditions.

<h3>Summary</h3>

Ocean Sense is an ocean-sensing platform which can be placed on a buoy or other ocean science apparatus and sent out to sea for about one week at a time. Many ocean science experiments are run off of buoys or other devices that stand alone in the field for an extended period of time. This board serves as a packaged sensor set which is able to measure and log three local sonditions during the experiments: <b>temperature, humidity</b>, and <b>acceleration</b>. As it currently stands, the board is not meant to be submerged underwater, but rather sit ontop of a buoy or equivalent flotation device for the duration of an experiment and then recollected. To travel into the depths of the ocean, an appropriate case will need to be engineered.

<h3>Motivation</h3>

During the summer of 2020, I was a <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/">Summer Student Fellow</a> at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). During my time researching the automatic detection of dispersive signals in the <a href="http://www.oal.whoi.edu/">Ocean Acoustics & Signals Lab</a>, I got to learn about the wide variety of science and engineering that pushes the development of ocean-centered technology. When it came time to begin my project during the fall 2020 academic semester in the Olin College class <i>Microcontrollers for the Real World</i>, I decided to create a platform that is meant to acompany the various ocean science experiments and vessels I learned about over the summer and measure the environmental conditions present throughout.
